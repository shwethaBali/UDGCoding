# Code Challange 1 - CSV Processing

A recurring requirement is the exchange of data between different systems. [CSV-Files (comma separated values)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSV_(Dateiformat)) are often used for this purpose, for example database exports, calendar applications or spreadsheets.

The data is e.g. exported from a source system, imported into a target system, processed and exported again.

## 1. Objective

The goal is to implement an application to process and prepare the enclosed CSV file. The task is divided into the following sub-tasks / functions.

1. Import the enclosed CSV file
2. Tabular representation of the data from the CSV file
3. Creation of new data records using the same schema
4. Processing of existing data records
5. Percentage representation of data records as a chart (bar or pie chart)
6. Export all data as a CSV file with the same scheme

## 2. Design

The presentation should be **structured** and **appealing** for users. Colors and fonts can be chosen freely. The front end should consist of only one page.

## 3. Implementation

You have a free hand in the choice of technologies. Whether JavaScript, PHP, C #, Java etc. is entirely up to you. Use what you master best.

The following is important to us:

- Why did you choose this technology / language
- How confident are you in dealing with the selected language / technology
- Why did you choose a particular framework

We want to know what level of knowledge you have.

### 3.1 Use of 3rd party libraries

The implementation can be done with the help of **3rd party libraries**. All libraries used (which are not part or dependency of a frontend or backend framework) must be **referenced**. Please also explain why you chose exactly these libraries.

### 3.2 Maintainability

Well-structured and documented code is important for implementation. Compliance with current **Best Practices** and **Coding Style Guidelines** (depending on the language / technology used) is desired.

Your code should be **readable** and **understandable** - even for third parties. The program flow should also be traceable.

Keep in mind that you and / or others need to build on this code and expand the project.

## 4. Supply

When you are finished with the task - or have only completed part of the time, you can provide us with your work result as follows:

1. Provide us with the link to your code repository
   - If you don't have one yet, you can get one of the leading providers (e.g. [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), [AzureDevOps](https://dev.azure.com/), ...) create an account and make your project available there.
   - Please make sure that the visibility of the repository is set to "Public"

2. Add a copy of the attached file [Task Result](Task&#32;Result.md) and fill in all points accordingly.

3. If you want to provide a demo of your project, [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) offers an easy way.
